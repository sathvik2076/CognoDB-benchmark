# CognoDB Cloud vs. Managed Graph Databases: A Reproducible Benchmark

A fair, scripted comparison of [CognoDB Cloud](https://console.cognodb.com) against four other managed/self-managed graph databases on the same dataset, same queries, same client, and matched resource tiers.

**TL;DR:** *(fill in after the first full run — one or two sentences on what stood out, e.g. "CognoDB and Neo4j Aura Free were within noise of each other on 1-hop traversals; Memgraph's in-memory engine pulled ahead on read-heavy mixed workloads at the cost of dataset size headroom; ArangoDB's larger free tier makes its numbers not directly comparable without the capped supplementary run.")*

---

## 1. Databases compared

| Platform | Query language | Why it's in this comparison |
|---|---|---|
| **CognoDB Cloud** (c0 free) | Cypher (Bolt) | The subject of the benchmark. |
| **Neo4j Aura Free** | Cypher (Bolt) | The most direct comparator — same query language and wire protocol as CognoDB, so any latency gap reflects the backend, not syntax or driver differences. |
| **Neo4j+** (self-managed, Docker-capped) | Cypher (Bolt) | Same engine as Aura but self-hosted and explicitly resource-capped (`docker-compose.neo4j-plus.yml`) to CognoDB's exact 0.5 vCPU / 256MB / 1GB spec — isolates "managed service overhead" from "raw engine performance" by giving us a controlled-hardware Neo4j data point. |
| **Memgraph Cloud** | Cypher (Bolt) | Also Cypher/Bolt, but an in-memory-first architecture — a genuine architectural contrast rather than another Neo4j-family engine, useful for the "why do platforms differ" analysis. |
| **Amazon Neptune** (Serverless, min capacity) | openCypher (HTTPS) | A major managed graph offering with no free tier — included deliberately to test the harness against a different wire protocol (HTTPS + optional SigV4) and to make the resource-parity trade-off explicit rather than excluding non-free platforms entirely. |
| **ArangoDB Oasis** | AQL | A different query language and multi-model engine, included for breadth. Its free trial tier is larger than CognoDB's (see fairness caveats below) — treat its raw numbers as directional, not resource-matched, unless the supplementary capped self-hosted run is also included. |

Four of five comparators share Cypher-over-Bolt with CognoDB, which is intentional: it lets the harness reuse one query template for most platforms (`src/workloads.py`), maximizing confidence that "same logical query" really means the same query, not a best-effort translation.

## 3. Dataset

**Source:** [IMDb non-commercial datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) (free for personal/non-commercial use, updated daily by IMDb — see [terms](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)).

**Graph shape:** `(:Person)-[:ACTED_IN {ordering, category}]->(:Movie {year, genres, runtime_minutes})`

Built by `src/dataset_prep.py`, which:
1. Downloads `title.basics.tsv.gz`, `name.basics.tsv.gz`, `title.principals.tsv.gz`.
2. Filters to `titleType=movie` with a known release year, and credits with `category in {actor, actress}`.
3. Samples ACTED_IN edges down to a target within the assignment's **100,000–500,000 relationship** range (default target: 250,000), then keeps only the Movie/Person rows actually referenced by the sampled edges — no orphaned nodes.
4. Writes `data/processed/{movies.csv, persons.csv, acted_in.csv}` — the single source of truth every platform loader reads, which is what guarantees "identical dataset" rather than five independent downloads that might drift.

*(Fill in after running: exact node/edge counts for this run, e.g. "38,412 movies, 194,006 persons, 250,000 ACTED_IN edges.")*

**Load method (identical across platforms):** driver-side batched `UNWIND`/AQL bulk insert via `src/loader.py`, batch size 2000 rows, nodes first then edges (edges matched to already-created nodes by id). No platform-specific bulk-import tool was used, so the load numbers measure driver-batched ingest specifically — call out if a platform's native bulk loader would materially change this (e.g. `neo4j-admin import`) and note that native bulk tools were intentionally excluded to keep the load *method* identical across platforms, not just the data.

## 4. Fairness: resource parity

| Platform | vCPU | RAM | Storage | Region | Caveats |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CognoDB Cloud | 0.5 (burstable) | 256 MB | 1 GB | *(fill in region picked)* | Baseline tier — every other platform is matched or capped to this. |
| Neo4j Aura Free | shared, not published | 1 GB | ~0.5 GB usable | *(fill in)* | RAM is 4x CognoDB's — documented, not hidden; Aura Free also auto-pauses after inactivity, excluded from cold-start numbers unless noted. |
| Neo4j+ (self-managed) | 0.5 (container-capped) | 256 MB (container-capped) | 1 GB (volume-capped) | same client region | Exact match to CognoDB by construction (`docker-compose.neo4j-plus.yml`) — the strongest fairness data point in this comparison. |
| Memgraph Cloud | *(fill in from console at run time)* | *(fill in)* | *(fill in)* | *(fill in)* | In-memory engine is an architectural difference independent of the resource tier — call this out in the analysis, don't let it read as an unfair advantage. |
| Amazon Neptune | min Neptune Capacity Units (NCU) | not published per-NCU | pay-per-GB (uncapped) | must match client region | **No free tier — this is the clearest resource-parity violation in the set.** Included anyway per the assignment's "your choice" latitude, with this caveat stated up front rather than glossed over. |
| ArangoDB Oasis | 2 (free trial) | 4 GB (free trial) | 10 GB (free trial) | *(fill in)* | Free trial tier is materially larger than CognoDB's. Numbers here are **not resource-matched** — treat as directional. *(If run: mention whether the supplementary self-hosted-and-capped ArangoDB run was also included.)* |

**Dataset sizing:** the dataset is sized (100k–500k relationships, ~250k default) so it fits inside CognoDB's 1GB free tier, per the assignment's fairness note — the same dataset is loaded everywhere, so no platform benefits from a smaller effective working set.

## 5. Methodology

- **Same dataset, same queries, same client, matched resources** (§4) for every platform.
- **Warm-up:** 20 unmeasured calls per read workload before the 100 measured iterations (both configurable via `.env`: `BENCH_WARMUP_ITERATIONS`, `BENCH_ITERATIONS`).
- **Percentiles, not just averages:** every read workload reports p50/p95/p99 (`src/metrics.py`, unit-tested in `tests/test_metrics.py`).
- **Mixed workload concurrency sweep:** 1 / 10 / 40 concurrent clients (`BENCH_CONCURRENCY_LEVELS`), 80/20 read/write mix, 15s sustained load per level, one connection per worker thread (`src/runner.py::run_mixed_workload`).
- **Automation:** `python scripts/run_all.py` loads data, runs every workload, and writes `results/results.json` for every configured platform in one command. `scripts/generate_readme_tables.py` turns that JSON into the tables in §7 — the tables are generated, not hand-typed, so they can't silently drift from the raw numbers.
- **Query correspondence across dialects:** `src/workloads.py` documents each workload's logical intent once, then gives the Cypher and AQL implementations side by side, so a reviewer can verify they're really the same query and not just similarly named.

### Required metrics → where they're implemented

| Metric (assignment §5.2) | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Ingest throughput | `src/loader.py::load_all` — nodes/sec, rels/sec, wall-clock |
| 1/2/3-hop traversal latency | `workloads.py::traversal_1hop/2hop/3hop`, p50/p95 via `runner.py` |
| Point lookup / indexed lookup | `workloads.py::point_lookup`, `indexed_filtered_lookup` (year is indexed on every platform that supports index DDL — Neptune auto-indexes, see adapter notes) |
| Aggregation | `workloads.py::aggregation_by_category` — count grouped by ACTED_IN.category |
| Mixed read/write throughput | `runner.py::run_mixed_workload`, swept at 1/10/40 clients |
| Footprint | `adapters/*.py::footprint()` — reports node/rel counts everywhere; storage/memory reported as "not observable via driver" where a platform doesn't expose it through Cypher/AQL, with a pointer to check the provider console manually |

## 6. Reproducing this benchmark

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, free/trial accounts on each platform in §1, Docker (for Neo4j+).

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd benchmark-graphdb
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Fill in .env with your own connection details for each platform.
# Never commit .env — it's gitignored.

# 1. Bring up the resource-capped self-managed Neo4j+ instance
docker compose -f docker-compose.neo4j-plus.yml up -d

# 2. Build the dataset (one-time, ~1.5GB download from IMDb)
python src/dataset_prep.py

# 3. Run the full benchmark suite across every configured platform
python scripts/run_all.py
# or a subset while iterating: python scripts/run_all.py --only cognodb memgraph_cloud

# 4. Generate the results tables
python scripts/generate_readme_tables.py > results/tables.md
# paste results/tables.md into section 7 below
```

Any platform without credentials in `.env` is automatically skipped (not failed) and marked accordingly in `results.json`, so you can run the suite incrementally as you provision each account.

## 8. Analysis

### Performance Summary

CognoDB Cloud successfully loaded 170,490 nodes and 99,989 relationships using the same dataset and workload definitions used throughout the benchmark.

### Read Performance

Point lookups and traversal workloads showed stable median latency around 264 ms. The 1-hop, 2-hop, and 3-hop traversals demonstrated similar performance, indicating efficient graph traversal execution for this dataset size.

### Aggregation Performance

Aggregation queries were significantly more expensive than lookups and traversals, with median latency above 1.3 seconds. This is expected because the query scans and groups all ACTED_IN relationships.

### Mixed Workload

Throughput increased from 3.27 QPS at concurrency 1 to 70.67 QPS at concurrency 40. Higher concurrency increased throughput but also increased tail latency, with p95 reaching approximately 1.1 seconds.

### Limitations

Results were collected on the CognoDB free tier (0.5 vCPU, 256 MB RAM). Network latency and free-tier resource limitations may affect results. Only one platform was benchmarked in this run; future work would compare the same dataset against Neo4j Aura, Memgraph, Neptune, and ArangoDB.

## 9. Known caveats (fill in as encountered during runs)

- [ ] Free-tier throttling observed on: *(platform, symptom, workaround)*
- [ ] Network variance: *(client region vs. each platform's region, if not identical)*
- [ ] Any failed/timed-out runs and how they were handled
- [ ] Query-language differences beyond what's captured in `workloads.py` (e.g. Neptune openCypher quirks vs. Neo4j Cypher)
- [ ] Aura Free auto-pause affecting any cold-start numbers
